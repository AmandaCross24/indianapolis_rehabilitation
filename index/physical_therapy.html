		<h3>Physical Therapy</h3>
		<div class="therapy">
			Whether you are recovering from an acute injury, are in need of post-operative rehabilitation, or are suffering from chronic pain, Indianapolis Rehabilitation Agency strives to provide an individualized treatment plan to meet your unique needs. Therapeutic exercises, biomechanics, sports rehabilitation, pain treatment for acute injuries and chronic pathologies, ultrasound, electrotherapy, and other therapeutic modalities are some of the services that we provide.<span style ="font-weight: bold"> Call 317-872-1501 to schedule an evaluation today!</span>
		</div>
		<div class="rehabilitation">
			<h3>Rehabilitation</h3>
			Rehabilitation, or functional mobility training, allows the patient to improve their lifestyle through the use of bracing, work-hardening, back and extremity supports, adaptive devices, and an individualized home exercise regimen.  Designed to facilitate health and wellness, our rehabilitation programs focus on physical fitness as well as injury restoration.
		</div>
		<div class="rehabilitation_counseling">
			<h3>Rehabilitation Counseling</h3>
			At Indianapolis Rehabilitation Agency, we address the physical, psychological, and emotional aspects of the healing process.  Very often, injury, pain, disability, and musculoskeletal pathology will affect not only the muscles, nerves, and joints, but will also influence work, activities of daily living, and interpersonal relationships.  At our clinic, we recognize and treat the holistic aspects that are critical parts of an individual's recovery and rehabilitation.
		</div>
		<div class="cognitive_therapy">
			<h3>Cognitive Therapy</h3>
			People who experience memory loss or dementia face many social and vocational obstacles that are difficult to overcome. With cognitive and psychoeducational care, patients can strive to retain or improve their condition.  Our goal is to implement a research-based plan of treatment, which includes the cognitive as well as the physical aspects of rehabilitation. 
		</div>
		<div class="disability_analysis">
			<h3>Disability Analysis</h3>
			Functional disability analysis is another professional service that is offered at Indianapolis Rehabilitation Agency.  Upon the referral of a physician, our facility offers functional capacity testing (FCEs) and vocational rehabilitation evaluations as part of our holistic approach to disability and rehabilitation.

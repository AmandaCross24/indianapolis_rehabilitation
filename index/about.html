			<p>Exercise is a key element of the physical therapy and rehabilitation process, and it has always been important to Dr. Cross.  He has coached and participated in a variety of sports throughout his life. While an undergraduate at Central College in Pella, Iowa, he played Varsity football and was a member of the 1974 NCAA Division III National Championship football team.  His personal experiences with exercise and physical therapy played an influential role in his decision to pursue physical therapy as a career.</p>

			<p>Dr. David L. Cross has been practicing physical therapy for more than 30 years.He has earned graduate degrees in Physical Therapy, Rehabilitation Counseling, and Rehabilitation Psychology from the University of Iowa, Purdue University, and Indiana University/IUPUI. He has fulfilled many professional, clinical, academic, and administrative roles within the fields of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Psychology. </p>

			<p>Most recently, in 2012, Dr. Cross accepted a physical therapy faculty appointment at Indiana State University.  As an assistant professor of physical therapy, he taught human anatomy and medical terminology.  He also published research on Alzheimer's Disease and back and hip rehab.  In 2014, he gained additional experience when he moved to New York City, where he was a pediatric physical therapist for the NYC Department of Education.  In late 2016, Dr. Cross moved back to Indiana and re-opened his clinical practice at Indianapolis Rehabilitation Agency.</p>

			<p>Having suffered multiple fractures from a car accident as a child, he understands the physical and psychological challenges related to healing and rehabilitation.  It is through his personal experience that he first gained an interest in the field of rehabilitation.</p> -->

			

			

			<p>From his studies, his research, and his experiences, he has developed the perspective that physical and mental health are clinically interrelated.  He hopes to help his patients with individualized plans of treatment that will assist them in the ultimate goal of rehabilitation, which translated literally, means "to live again." </p>
